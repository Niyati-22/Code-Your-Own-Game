This project is a hangman game. It is a multiplayer version, in which friends can use one game to play against each other. This program uses serialization to update a global leaderboard that shows the scores of every player that has ever played this game. When a user exits the game, the global leaderboard will update and display all the scores. This program was coded by Niyati Trivedi.
